# 📰 Fake News Detection using NLP & Machine Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement
Fake news on social media misleads people. This project builds an **AI tool** to detect whether a news article is **real** or **fake**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to classify news articles as **real or fake**.
- Demonstrate preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF).
- Train and evaluate classifiers (Passive Aggressive, SVM, etc.).

---

## 📂 Dataset
Use any labeled fake news dataset, e.g.:
- [Fake News Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data)

Ensure the dataset has:
- `text`: news article body
- `label`: real or fake

Save the dataset as **`news.csv`** in the project folder.
